In my final project for Econometrics, my partner and I studied the relationship between income and the presence of a Bachelor’s degree. Our theory was that the presence of a bachelor’s degree has the ability to overcome obstacles that are created by family situations. For example, a student who comes from a low income, low education family that earns a bachelor’s degree will be able to earn a higher level of income based on the presence of their bachelor’s degree. Said differently, the bachelor’s degree has a stronger effect on income than family characteristics. We grouped income level into two different groups and ran a variety of regressions that ultimately confirmed our results.
